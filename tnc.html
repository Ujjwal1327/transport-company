                <p>While our company aims to provide on time deliveries, but we cannot ignore some unforeseen scenarios
                    such as
                    road traffic, natural phenomenon, vehicle breakout or accident. While we provide you can estimated
                    time
                    deliveries but that timeline is considered when things go normally throughout the transit. So please
                    beware
                    that sometimes your goods might take one or two extra days. In case of delays our team will help you
                    and
                    inform about every movement of your goods. We always strive to deliver within agreed timelines, but
                    request
                    your cooperation and patience during unforeseen events. No compensation will be provided for
                    delay-related
                    inconveniences unless contractually specified. </p>

                    hours
                    before the scheduled pickup. If you wish to reschedule your move, we allow reschedule, mostly free
                    but in
                    case of extra traffic, you might have to pay extra charges compared to the initial agreed amount.
                    Once items
                    are loaded and on move, there will be no refund. </p>
            </div>
            <div>


                 
                <h2>9. Prohibited Items</h2>
                <p> Our company will not be held accountable for transporting perishable goods or banned items in
                    specific
                    states. For instance, shipping alcohol alongside other goods makes you responsible for it and could
                    lead
                    to
                    direct legal action. If any such items are discovered during loading or unloading, they may be
                    reported
                    to
                    authorities in accordance with applicable law. It is the client’s responsibility to declare the
                    contents
                    of
                    their shipment honestly. Failure to do so may result in penalties or legal action.</p>
            </div>
            <div>


                <h2> 10. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>

                <p> Our company is abided by all the rules and regulation of Indian Government under the information
                    technology
                    act, 2000. In the event of a dispute, both parties are encouraged to resolve the issue through
                    mutual
                    discussion or arbitration before initiating formal legal action. This ensures transparency,
                    fairness, and
                    quicker resolution.</p>
            </div>
            <div>


                <h2>11. Modifications to Terms</h2>

                <p>Our Company reserves the right to update or change these Terms and Conditions at any time without
                    prior
                    notice. Changes may reflect new service features, changes in law, or business requirements. The
                    updated
                    version of our T&C will always be pushed on our official website, and it is the client's
                    responsibility
                    to
                    review them before confirming a booking. Continuing to use our services after the changes confirms
                    your
                    acceptance of the new terms.</p>
