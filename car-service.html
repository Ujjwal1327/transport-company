        <h2>What is Car Transport?</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="assets/images/car-service-page-img1.png" alt="">
            Car transportation is the process of relocating your car from location A to B. It’s commonly used for
            relocation and moves, either by individuals shipping one or two cars or businesses shipping multiple cars at
            once. Whether you’re shipping within a state or interstate, choosing the right mode of transportation can
            save you money while ensuring fast shipping.
            <br> <br>
            There are two main options for car transportation: Open and Enclosed Transportation. 
            In open car transportation, your car is exposed to the elements, which can cause damage from weather, dust,
            and debris.
            Enclosed car transportation, It involves putting your car in a container that protects it from these
            weather, dust and debris. This option comes with an additional cost, usually around 20-35% more than open
            transport.
            <br> <br>
            When You choose a car transportation company, it’s important to select a professional car transporter who
            can help you find the right option based on your needs. For instance, if you’re transporting your everyday
            car, open car transport is often the best choice. It’s more affordable and is used in almost 95% of auto
            transport cases.
            <br>
            <br>
            A professional car mover will offer an affordable car-moving solution tailored to your needs.
            <br>
            <br>
            Transporting your car with NextGen Safe N Secure is simpler, smoother, and more affordable.

            <h3>Step 4: Prepare your car.</h3>
            <p>Once your booking is complete, it’s time to prepare your car. Before handing it over for transporter,
                follow these practices to ensure a smooth journey.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 5: Tracking</h3>
            <p>Once your car is handed over to the car carriers, you’ll get a tracking Id to monitor its movements. If
                you notice anything off, such as the car not moving as per the schedule, contact the transporter
                directly and inquire about the issue and the estimated time for resolution.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Step 6: Delivery:</h3>
            <p>When your car is delivered to you, ensure everything is the same as it was before loading. Inspect it
                thoroughly in presence of the transporter, as this will help with the claim procedure if anything
                happens during transit.

        <h2>Cost for shipping your car across India</h2>
        <p>350 km to 700 km journey: In India, average costs for 300-700km ranges between Rs 5,000 and Rs 11,000 for a
            standard sedan. The cost can increase for SUVs or larger vehicles like Toyota Hiluxes and Fortuners, as they
            require more fuel and are significantly heavier than sedans</p>
        <p>700 km to 1500 km journey: You can expect a price range of Rs 11,000 to Rs 25,000. These prices are for
            standard SUVs and sedans, but the cost for cars like Toyota Hiluxes and Fortuners or any other big vehicles
            can increase.
        </p>
        <p>
            1400 km to 2800 km journey: you can expect a price range of Rs 21,000 to Rs 50,000. Again, these prices are
            for standard SUVs and sedans, but the cost for cars like Toyota Hilux and Fortunes can increase.

                Factors that can affect the cost of car shipping
            </h2>
            <p>
                There are various factors that influence the cost
                of car shipping in India.

                <h3>Mode of transport:</h3>
                <p>Open transport is 20-30% cheaper than enclosed transport, but it offers less protection. In open
                    transport, your car is exposed to external entities like weather, dust, and debris, while enclosed
                    transport protects your car from these.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Distance</h3>
                <p>The longer the distance, the higher will be the price for transportation. Terrains also plays a major
                    role in determining the cost; for example, transporting a car to Srinagar is more costly because
                    they have less rail infrastructure and deadly commuting routes.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Shipping Methods: </h3>
                <p>Terminal to Terminal: This is an affordable method for transporting your car, but it’s a bit unsafe
                    and less flexible as you’ll need to visit specific terminal points for pick-up and drop-off.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Door-to-door shipping </h3>
                <p>It offers convenience, as the vehicle will be picked up and dropped off at your chosen location.
                    However, it comes with a premium cost, which may vary depending on the drop-off and pickup
                    locations.
